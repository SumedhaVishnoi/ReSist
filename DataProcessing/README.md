# üóÇÔ∏è Dataset Structure & Category Definitions

This document provides a detailed explanation of the categories and features used in the dataset for predicting faulty components in units based on error codes

---

## Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of **1056 records** (960 TRX units, 96 PSU units) collected from the repair workflow at Nokia stations.
Each record includes metadata, test results, and final replaced components.

## üìÅ Key Fields and Categories

### üîπ `Incoming_Test_Result`
- **Components:**
  - **Pass/Fail:** Binary
  - **Categories:** Fail codes are given as 'FAIL - ID-25 BBOX FILE CHECK TEST F1D16, ID-27 NCU DETECTION MADE 2'
  - Hence Multiple categories were made such as
  - 1. BBOX
    2. NCU
    3. SELFCAL TEST
    4. CONNECT MADE
    5. POWER RESET TEST 
    6. CONNECT MASTER CPU
    7. ANT POWER BF (MADE,TRX)
    8. READ MADE EYE

### üîπ `Module_Test_Result`
- **Components:**
  - **Pass/Fail:** Binary
  - **Categories:**
  - 1. M04
    2. M32
---


### üîπ `Replaced_Components`
- **CompID:** Location of the faulty component
- **CompCode:** The replaced component
- - **CompType:** The details of the replaced component
- **Purpose:** This is the **target** variable for the ML model.

 
##  Engineered Features

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `combo_code` | Concatenation of Incoming and Module error codes (e.g., `E10_M210`) |
| `yet to add` | yet to add |
| `yet to add` | yet to add |
| `yet to add` | yet to add |

## üè∑Ô∏è Target Labels (Components Replaced)

- **Multi-label Format**: A single record may involve replacement of more than one component.
- **Examples of Labels:**
  - `X` ‚Äì Main Power IC
  - `Y` ‚Äì RF Driver
  - `Z` ‚Äì Clock Buffer
  - `P`, `Q`, `R` ‚Äì (Other internal codes as per board)

These labels are used for classification by the ML model.

## üßΩ Notes on Preprocessing

- Text fields normalized to uppercase
- Null rows removed (especially missing Unit_ID or codes)
- Categories encoded using LabelEncoder / OneHotEncoder based on model type
- Stratified sampling used if labels are imbalanced

## Usage in Model

The final dataset with categorized and engineered features is used to train classification models such as:
- `RandomForestClassifier`
- `XGBoostClassifier`
- Fallback: Rule-based on combo_code probabilities

---

## Final Notes

- Component categories may evolve as more failure types are logged.
- Error codes are derived from structured test logs and are deterministic in nature.
- Dataset is used for internal prediction and automation at Nokia repair facilities.
